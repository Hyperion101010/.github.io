## A developer based adaption of gatsby theme [kross-hugo](https://github.com/themefisher/kross-hugo)

Contains most of the fields required for a software developer portfolio 
along with optional blog component. Can be further developed to host a
freelancer homepage, small business and what not!

I hope you enjoy it.
